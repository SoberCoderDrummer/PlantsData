# PlantsData
General infos about indoor plants, their needs and particularities. All that with a 2D library such as SFML, SDL, OPENGL or possibly ALLEGRO. Gonna start with 150 plants that I learned through my horticulture class. All the data; names, needs, etc, will be taken from my manual and put in C++ objects.
